# Discord_bot
A functioning social media bot to the platform Discord, programmed in Python with the help of discord.py module. This bot provides functions such as moderation and games as some misc functions.

The modules you have to install are discord.py and python-dotenv as the program makes use of .env files to keep the bot's token hidden and therefore you need to create your own .env file with the contents consisting of "TOKEN=(token)"

The bot's command prefix is "//" and with it you can access many commands. To start of, the cogs used are labelled as [features, games, greetings, moderation] and the self made modules they use are [8_ball, Connect_4, Rock_Paper_Scissors, Ultimate_Tic_Tac_toe, bad_words]
